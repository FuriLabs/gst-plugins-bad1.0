Package: gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Section: sound
Depends: gstreamer1.0-plugins-good (>= 1.18.0)
Description: GStreamer plugin for PulseAudio (transitional package)
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package used to contain the GStreamer plugin for PulseAudio, a
 sound server for POSIX and WIN32 systems.
 .
 This is a transitional package.
